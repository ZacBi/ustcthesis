  abstract  = {We present a new annotation scheme for normalizing time expressions, such as {``}three days ago{''}, to computer-readable forms, such as 2016-03-07. The annotation scheme addresses several weaknesses of the existing TimeML standard, allowing the representation of time expressions that align to more than one calendar unit (e.g., {``}the past three summers{''}), that are defined relative to events (e.g., {``}three weeks postoperative{''}), and that are unions or intersections of smaller time expressions (e.g., {``}Tuesdays and Thursdays{''}). It achieves this by modeling time expression interpretation as the semantic composition of temporal operators like UNION, NEXT, and AFTER. We have applied the annotation scheme to 34 documents so far, producing 1104 annotations, and achieving inter-annotator agreement of 0.821.}

The aim of the task is to parse time expressions into the compositional semantic graphs of the Semantically Compositional Annotation of Time Expressions (SCATE) schema, which allows the representation of a wider variety of time expressions than previous approaches. Two tracks were included, one to evaluate the parsing of individual components of the produced graphs, in a classic information extraction way, and another one to evaluate the quality of the time intervals resulting from the interpretation of those graphs. Though 40 participants registered for the task, only one team submitted output, achieving 0.55 F1 in Track 1 (parsing) and 0.70 F1 in Track 2 (intervals).}

the last comprehensive empirical evaluation of supervised learning was the Statlog
Project in the early 90's. We present a large-scale empirical comparison between ten
supervised learning methods: SVMs, neural nets, logistic regression, naive bayes,
memory-based learning, random forests, decision trees, bagged trees, boosted trees,
and boosted stumps. We also examine the effect that calibrating the models via Platt
Scaling and Isotonic Regression has on their performance. An important aspect of our
study is the use of a variety of performance criteria to evaluate the learning methods.},
